# Intelligent File Size Management (MongoDB + Caching)

## Goals

- **Performance-First**: Optimize bundle sizes with intelligent caching and lazy loading
- **Database Efficiency**: MongoDB query optimization and connection pooling
- **Pattern Learning**: Smart loading of ML algorithms based on usage patterns
- **Automatic Optimization**: Detect, report, and prevent regressions with AI-assisted recommendations

## Intelligent Budgets (Enhanced)

- **`packages/sdk`**: < 8KB gzip (zero-config intelligence with lazy loading)
- **`packages/vite-plugin`**: < 5KB gzip (seamless integration with caching)
- **`packages/pattern-learning`**: < 15KB gzip (ML algorithms with dynamic imports)
- **`packages/engine`**: Minimal runtime with intelligent caching
- **`packages/mongodb-adapter`**: < 10KB gzip (connection pooling and query optimization)
- **Example apps**: < 2% bundle delta with intelligent feature loading
- **Database overhead**: < 5MB MongoDB with optimized indexing

## Comprehensive Monitoring

- **Bundle Analysis**: size-limit/bundlesize with gzip/brotli and caching impact assessment
- **Database Performance**: MongoDB query profiling and connection pool monitoring
- **Cache Efficiency**: Hit/miss ratios and memory usage tracking
- **Pattern Learning**: Algorithm performance and memory footprint monitoring
- **Build Stats**: Enhanced tsup/rollup/vite analysis with dynamic import optimization
- **Real-time Metrics**: Live monitoring dashboard with performance trend analysis

### Intelligent Baselines

- **Dynamic Baselines**: Adjust based on feature usage and caching effectiveness
- **Performance Correlation**: Link bundle size to caching hit rates and query performance
- **PR Integration**: Automated comments with optimization suggestions and migration impact

### Enhanced size-limit Configuration

`package.json` snippet:

```json
{
  "size-limit": [
    { "path": "dist/sdk.min.js", "limit": "8 KB", "gzip": true },
    { "path": "dist/vite-plugin.js", "limit": "5 KB", "gzip": true },
    { "path": "dist/pattern-learning.min.js", "limit": "15 KB", "gzip": true },
    { "path": "dist/mongodb-adapter.min.js", "limit": "10 KB", "gzip": true },
    {
      "path": "dist/engine.min.js",
      "limit": "12 KB",
      "gzip": true,
      "ignore": ["mongodb", "fs-extra"]
    }
  ],
  "scripts": {
    "size": "size-limit",
    "size:cache": "size-limit --cache",
    "size:analyze": "size-limit --analyze"
  }
}
```
