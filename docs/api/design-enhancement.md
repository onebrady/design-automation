## ❌ NON-EXISTENT: Track Pattern Usage

**Endpoint**: `POST /api/design/patterns/track`  
**Migration Status**: ❌ **Does Not Exist** - Moved to [`docs/app/issues/migration-issues.md`](../app/issues/migration-issues.md)  
**Validation Status**: ❌ **Not Implemented** (2025-09-06) - Endpoint returns 404 not found  
**Issue**: False documentation for non-existent endpoint

**Investigation Results**:

- ✅ Related GET endpoint (`/api/design/patterns/learned`) exists and works correctly
- ❌ POST tracking endpoint not implemented despite detailed documentation
- ❌ No pattern tracking infrastructure exists in current system
- ❌ Fire-and-forget functionality claimed but not available

**Recommendation**: Remove false documentation and consider implementing if machine learning features needed

**Reference**: Issue details documented in [`docs/app/issues/migration-issues.md`](../app/issues/migration-issues.md)
