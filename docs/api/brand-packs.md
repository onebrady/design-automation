**🎯 Migration Complete**

**📋 Evidence-Based Findings:**

- ✅ **3/8 endpoints verified and documented** in [`docs/app/api/core/brand-management.md`](../app/api/core/brand-management.md)
- ❌ **5/8 endpoints are fictional** - documented in [`docs/app/issues/migration-issues.md`](../app/issues/migration-issues.md)

**🔍 Data Reality Check:**

- **Fictional brand packs in docs**: "western-companies", "arm-truck-corp", "expanded-test"
- **Actual brand packs in system**: "redis-test-brand", "test-brand-pack", "test-verification"

**📁 This file demonstrates why evidence-based validation is critical - contained 62.5% false information.**
