# API Documentation Migration Strategy

**Purpose**: Systematic migration of endpoint documentation from `docs/api` to `docs/app/api` with 100% validation.

## üéØ **Migration Objective**

Establish `docs/app/api` as the single source of truth by migrating verified endpoint details from `docs/api` files and removing the entire `docs/api` folder upon completion.

## üîÑ **Migration Process (Per Endpoint)**

### Phase 1: Read & Analyze

1. **Read complete endpoint documentation** from source file in `docs/api`
2. **Identify target location** in `docs/app/api` structure
3. **Note documented request/response details** for validation

### Phase 2: 100% Validation

1. **Test endpoint with exact documented request format** using curl
2. **Verify all request fields** work as specified
3. **Compare actual response structure** with documented structure
4. **Test example requests** from documentation
5. **Document any discrepancies** found

### Phase 3: Documentation Decision

**If endpoint works as documented or better:**

- Enhance `docs/app/api` with verified comprehensive details
- Add missing functionality discovered during testing
- Include complete request/response examples
- Update usage examples with correct port/format

**If endpoint has issues:**

- Document actual behavior in `docs/app/api` (the verified truth)
- Create/update `docs/app/issues/migration-issues.md` with issue details
- Note expected vs. actual behavior
- Include error details and investigation steps

### Phase 4: Cleanup

- **Remove detailed endpoint documentation** from source `docs/api` file
- **Replace with migration status** and reference to docs/app/api documentation
- **Update progress counter** using format: `‚úÖ **X endpoints remaining** (X/Total - Y migrated to docs/app/api)`
- **Mark migration task as completed** in tracking system

## üìã **Critical Success Factors**

### ‚úÖ **Always Validate First**

- **NEVER migrate without testing** - Documentation may be aspirational
- **Test with exact documented request format** - Verify compatibility
- **Document actual behavior** - Not aspirational behavior
- **Preserve evidence** - Keep test results and error messages

### ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Enhancement**

- **Include ALL discovered functionality** - Real implementations often exceed documentation
- **Document complete response structures** - Don't summarize complex responses
- **Add missing request fields** - Capture all available options
- **Update performance metrics** - Use actual measured response times

### ‚úÖ **Evidence-Based Documentation**

- **Only document verified functionality** - Test everything before writing
- **Include working examples** - With correct ports and request formats
- **Preserve detailed response structures** - Don't simplify for brevity
- **Note version-specific behavior** - Capture current implementation reality

## üìÅ **File Structure Targets**

### Source Files (docs/api)

- Various files containing endpoint documentation
- May contain aspirational/outdated information
- Should be systematically emptied then removed

### Target Files (docs/app/api)

- **`design/enhancement.md`** - Basic CSS enhancement endpoints
- **`design/transformations.md`** - Advanced transformation systems
- **`core/health-system.md`** - System health and configuration
- **`intelligence/visual-analysis.md`** - AI-powered analysis systems
- **And others** - Based on functional organization

### Issue Tracking

- **`docs/app/issues/migration-issues.md`** - Document endpoint implementation problems
- Include: Expected behavior, actual behavior, error details, investigation results
- Format: Clear issue descriptions with reproduction steps

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Migration Patterns Discovered**

### Pattern 1: Enhanced Implementation

**Issue**: Actual endpoints provide MORE functionality than documented
**Action**: Document all discovered features, don't limit to original docs
**Example**: Animation endpoint provides 11 utilities + 8 keyframes vs. basic transition enhancement

### Pattern 2: Response Structure Differences

**Issue**: Actual response fields differ from documentation
**Action**: Document actual structure, note differences if significant
**Example**: `scale` object vs. `typographyMetrics` object in typography endpoint

### Pattern 3: Additional Features

**Issue**: Endpoints include recommendations, tokens, or metadata not documented
**Action**: Include ALL response fields with examples
**Example**: Smart recommendations and comprehensive token systems

## üìä **Progress Tracking**

### Migration Status Template

```markdown
## Status Overview

‚úÖ **X endpoints remaining** (X/Total - Y migrated to docs/app/api)
```

### Completion Criteria

- All endpoint documentation migrated from source files
- All endpoints 100% validated and documented accurately
- Source `docs/api` files empty and ready for removal
- Any issues documented in `migration-issues.md`
- `docs/app/api` is complete and accurate single source of truth

## üö® **Quality Gates**

### Before Migration

- [ ] Endpoint tested with documented request format
- [ ] Response structure verified against documentation
- [ ] All request fields validated
- [ ] Performance metrics captured

### After Migration

- [ ] Documentation includes all discovered functionality
- [ ] Examples use correct ports and formats
- [ ] Response structures are complete and accurate
- [ ] Any issues properly documented

### Final Validation

- [ ] Migrated documentation is more comprehensive than source
- [ ] All examples work as documented
- [ ] No functionality lost in translation
- [ ] Source documentation removed

**Remember**: The goal is not just to move documentation, but to create the most accurate and comprehensive API documentation possible through systematic validation and enhancement.
