# Enhanced Roadmap & Milestones (14 Weeks - Level 3 Automation + MongoDB)

## Phase 0 — Intelligent Foundation (Week 1)

- **Repo Setup**: Monorepo scaffolding with pnpm workspaces and TypeScript strict mode
- **Quality Gates**: ESLint with MongoDB schema validation, Vitest/Jest with pattern learning tests
- **Database Layer**: MongoDB setup with connection pooling and basic schema validation
- **Build System**: Enhanced CI with size-limit, husky hooks, and intelligent caching
- **Discovery**: Zero-config resolver (env → .agentic/config.json → package.json → brand-pack.ref.json|brand-pack.json → DB mapping → auto-bind when single brand)
- **API**: `/api/context` endpoint returns brand/project/degraded state; health reports Mongo availability
- **SDK**: Status notifications for Mongo availability and degraded mode; lock snapshot usage
- **Data Schemas**: Define `projects`, `cache`, `transforms`, `patterns` with required indexes and TTL policies (see data-schemas)
- **Exit Criteria**: All quality gates active; MongoDB connectivity verified; brand discovery works end-to-end; `/api/context` returns expected data; degraded mode notifies and uses lock snapshot; indexes auto-created on startup; cache signature and invalidation tests pass; pattern learning test framework ready

## Phase 2 — Design Intelligence Engine (Weeks 4–6)

- **Core Transforms**: AST-based enhancements for CSS/HTML/JSX with pattern learning
- **Intelligent Caching**: Multi-level caching system with hash-based invalidation
- **Pattern Recognition**: Usage pattern analysis and component correlation tracking
- **Performance Optimization**: Cached results for instant re-enhancement
- **Vite Integration**: Dev-only plugin with seamless agent integration
- **SDK Foundation**: Zero-config SDK with automatic project detection
- **Confidence Boosters**: Exact-match detection, AA pre-checks, layout-safety heuristics, project consistency checks, progressive application
- **Exit Criteria**: Pattern learning operational with safe auto-apply (spacing, radius/elevation, exact token mappings) at ≥0.9; advisory for others (≥0.8); confidence boosters active; caching >70% hit rate; golden suite stable; performance targets met

## Phase 3 — Pattern Learning Engine (Weeks 7–8)

- **Pattern Recognition**: User preference analysis and component correlation algorithms
- **Usage Analytics**: Comprehensive tracking of design patterns and effectiveness

- **Learning Validation**: Confidence scoring and pattern accuracy testing
- **Performance Tuning**: Optimize pattern learning algorithms for speed and accuracy
- **Exit Criteria**: Pattern learning >80% accuracy; usage analytics operational; intelligent suggestions working; advisory-only changes enforced; performance benchmarks met

## Phase 4 — Seamless Integration (Weeks 9–10)

- **Level 3 Automation**: Zero-config agent integration with automatic project detection
- **Intelligent SDK**: Transparent communication with pattern learning and caching
- **IDE Integration**: VSCode extension with background enhancement and proactive suggestions
- **Build Integration**: Seamless CI/CD integration with intelligent caching
- **Performance Optimization**: Advanced caching strategies and memory management
- **Exit Criteria**: Zero-manual-setup workflow functional; agents work transparently; IDE integration seamless; performance targets exceeded

## Phase 5 — Intelligence & Optimization (Weeks 11–12)
