# Studio (Minimal)

Phase 1 target: basic create/edit brand and preview exports.

For MVP, use the server endpoints:
- POST /api/brand-packs
- POST /api/brand-packs/:id/version
- GET /api/brand-packs/:id/export/css
- GET /api/brand-packs/:id/export/json

A minimal UI can be added later; this README is the placeholder artifact for Phase 1.
